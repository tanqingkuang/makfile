The folder is used to learn makefile funtion ---- zhangmeng 2018/6/30


All folders with differet versions have same C-files ane H-files.

The work of project is very simple, which is just printing "Hello world" and "Hi world".

A project has three C-files and two H-files: main.c print_hello.c print_hello.h print_hi.c print_hi.h.

	A function is defined in the "print_hello.c" to printf "Hello world", which is declared in the "print_hello.h".

	A function is defined in the "print_hi.c" to printf "Hi world", which is declared in the "print_hi.h".

	The main function in the "main.c" calls two print function, so the "main.c" file has to include the two H-files.

The differences in different version are "makefile" and "Note" files.

	With the version increase, the "makefile" files will be more complex and more easily to true subject.

	There are some brief implementation method of "makefile" in the "Note" files.

Users can use "make" command to produce a "edit" which is the result of the compilation and some *.o which are object files, and use "make clean" to deletethe result and object files.
